# Walmart-Database-Schema-SQL
The project is a Walmart hypothetical database that supports 15 various business functions.

The repository features three files:
1. A database.mwb file that shows the database schema as an Entity Relationship (ERD) Diagram using MySQL Workbench. The database supports 15 business functions within Walmart, which were initially conceptualized using this diagram
2. An inserts.sql file that enters a randomized fake sample of 20 rows for each table/business function. For the sake of maintaining context, the 20 rows were edited to be as relevant as possible
3. A functions.sql file that hosts 2 queries per table to show how the database supports the 15 business functions
